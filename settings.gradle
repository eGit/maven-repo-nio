/*
Gradle tries to locate a settings.gradle (Groovy DSL) or a settings.gradle.kts 
(Kotlin DSL) file with every invocation of the build. For that purpose, the 
runtime walks the hierarchy of the directory tree up to the root directory. The 
algorithm stops searching as soon as it finds the settings file. Always add 
a settings.gradle to the root directory of your build to avoid the initial 
performance impact. This recommendation applies to single project builds as well 
as multi-project builds.
